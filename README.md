# Telerik DevOps course `k8s`
Testing what I've learned from Telerik DevOps course topic k8s

> Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system originally deisgned by Google with initial release in 2014, now maintened by the cloud native computing foundation. Provides a *platform* for automating deployment, scaling and operations of cotainer workloads.

What we'll learn:

* Kubernetes building blocks
* Pods, Deployments, Labels and Selectors and how they relate to each other
* Deploying a Stand-Alone application
* How to deploy applications in Kubernetes

## Why do we need container orchestration:
```
Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling and netwokring of containers
```

## Kubernetes in the cloud:
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)

Honorable mention:
* Nomad - A simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale.

Kubernetes features:
* Storage orchestration;
* Secret and configuration management;
* Automatic bin packing;
* Self-healing;
* Automated rollouts and rollbacks;
* Service discovery and load balancing.
